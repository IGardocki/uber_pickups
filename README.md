# Things I learned:

Streamlit is really cool, and has a lot of great functionality.

The docs suggest adding a requirements.txt file before deploying. This created a lot of problems in deployment with share.streamlit.io.

In the future, I'll probably just rely on imports vs creating a requirements.txt file.
